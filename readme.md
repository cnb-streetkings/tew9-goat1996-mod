## 🔥 About the Mod

**G.O.A.T. 1996** (Genesis of Attitude Takeover) is a fully overhauled, high-detail mod for **Total Extreme Wrestling IX**, built on the
classic foundation of _Dawn of Attitude (DOA 1996)_ by BurningHamster and team (Grimmas, Justtxyank, NightshadexTsumirren, MagnusD, Nachtfalter,
TNAFever).

Rebuilt from the ground up by **The Street Kings** — AznIronMan & Tomokaari — this version is designed to push the TEW IX engine to its limits.
Every record, detail, promotion, and worker has been carefully reimagined, revamped, and enhanced.

There are several things that may not be exactly histroically accurate, but that was done for a series of reasons:

- Balancing the game world to reflect how the data was structured for the Cornellverse (how the game is intended to work).
- Making sure that certain events still carry out over time as they would have in the real world, if there is no direct player intervention.
- Decisions made after hundreds of hours of simulations and play testing.

The mod is designed to be a fun and engaging experience, and we hope you enjoy it.
